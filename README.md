# P(AI)ano

P(AI)ano is a creative and interactive musical experience implemented in Processing, allowing users to play piano sounds using their computer keyboard. The project incorporates AI-generated musical suggestions for added inspiration. The program utilizes the Minim library for audio processing.


## Project Background

This project was developed as part of the CreativeCoding BIP program by Fulda.de. The BIP program is an initiative aimed at fostering creativity and innovation through coding projects. The authors of this project are students at ESTBarreiro, Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal.


## Features

- Play piano sounds with the computer keyboard.
- White keys are mapped to the keys 'a' to 'ç', while black keys are mapped to 'w', 'e', 't', 'y', 'u', 'o', and 'p'.
- Each key triggers a unique piano sound.
- Visual feedback: The keys change color when pressed, creating an engaging and dynamic display.
- Musical suggestions: Press the spacebar to toggle AI-generated musical suggestions.
- AI-generated suggestions include compositions inspired by Beethoven and Mozart, as well as an original suggestion.


## Design Inspiration

The design of the piano and color palette draws inspiration from konkret kunst, a form of concrete art that emphasizes geometric shapes and non-representational forms.


## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Processing 4.3 installed on your machine.
2. Place your sound files (e.g., "w1.wav", "w2.wav", etc.) in the same folder as your project.
3. Open the "FinalPiano" sketch in the Processing IDE.
4. Run the sketch (click the "Run" button).


## Instructions

- Press the keys 'a' to 'ç' for white keys and 'w', 'e', 't', 'y', 'u', 'o', 'p' for black keys to play piano sounds.
(ATTENTION!!! READ ProjectDocumentation to change the keys!!!)
- Toggle musical suggestions by pressing the spacebar.
- Explore different sound combinations and get inspired by AI-generated musical suggestions.
